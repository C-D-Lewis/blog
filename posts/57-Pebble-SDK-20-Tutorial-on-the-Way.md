So after getting some experience in updating most of my 1.X watchfaces/apps to SDK 2.0, I feel it is time to start writing the corresponding tutorial!

This time I will take a more practical approach, with each section culminating in a compilable project that shows off the subject matter.

The [1.X tutorial series](http://ninedof.wordpress.com/pebble-sdk-tutorial/) will still be valid for tinkering around and releasing apps until 2.0 goes officially live, and is also a good introduction to how the Pebble SDK is made up; so if you want to get a general look at getting started have a look at that. But be aware a lot will change soon!

Stay tuned!
