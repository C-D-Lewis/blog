If you haven't heard, [this is a Pebble Smartwatch](http://getpebble.com/). Mine is in the post somewhere between Heathrow and my house... But there is no post on weekends!

Instead, I've spent a lot of today setting up the Pebble SDK toolchain and dependencies on a Ubuntu Virtual Machine, and brushing up on my C++ so that when it arrives, I can make my own watch apps!

The fantastic thing about it is that it is completely open, and there are lots of code examples, which I can understand thanks to my tinkering with C and Java.

As a sample of what the community has already achieved, here is John Cleese as a watchface app. [Source here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/1c8bho/swalks_watch_face_loads_fine_with_current_pebble/).
