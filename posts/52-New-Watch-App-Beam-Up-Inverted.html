By request, I have made an inverted version of the <a title="Beam Up at MyPebbleFaces" href="http://www.mypebblefaces.com/apps/3905/6741/">Beam Up</a> watch face:

<a href="http://ninedof.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mockup2.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1203" alt="mockup" src="http://ninedof.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mockup2.gif" width="144" height="168" /></a>It's available now at <a title="Beam Up Inverter at MyPebbleFaces" href="http://www.mypebblefaces.com/apps/3905/6741/6746/">mypebblefaces</a>, and I'll add it to the Watch App Selector in due course, to avoid spamming the Play Store with updates. Enjoy!
