Here's a preview of something interesting I've been working on. All I'll say right now (until I have more to show) is that is uses my newest multi-threaded, TCP enabled Java 2D game engine, and it's like having a model railway on your PC. And after swapping a few <code>BufferedImages</code> for <code>Bitmaps</code>, possibly in your pocket!

<ul>
	<li>Sixteen types of placeable track (straight, curves, crossrails, points)</li>
	<li>A depot with GUI that enables creation of services from the top left</li>
	<li>Intelligent navigation of all track and points, including stop signals</li>
	<li>Text file saving/loading of complete maps, except services.</li>
</ul>
More details soon!
