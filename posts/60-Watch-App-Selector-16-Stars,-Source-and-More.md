<p style="text-align:left;">Also included are a new watch app, Starfield Graphics Demo, as well as two new faces based on the demo: Starfield and Starfield Power Saver. The latter animates only once a second to save battery power.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Both are available on mypebblefaces, or with future updates and a whole bunch more stuff on Google Play as part of Watch App Selector:</p>
