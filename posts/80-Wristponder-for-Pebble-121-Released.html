<strong>UPDATES: </strong>

A few points regarding other requested features:
<ol>
	<li>Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Google Voice do not at the moment have APIs that allow background composition and sending of messages without user interaction. If I am incorrect, please let me know!</li>
	<li>Persistent storage of responses for faster launch on the watch is on the horizon, but it needs a few kinks ironed out first.</li>
	<li>Implementing a 'top 5 received SMS contacts' feature<del> is only possible for Android phones with API level 18 (Android 4.3) or greater, so not worth implementation just yet. Still a desirable feature though.</del> Appears to be doable! More soon.</li>
</ol>
