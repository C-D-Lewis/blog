This one took a while. Weighing in at 38 versions and I-don't-know-how-many reflected and hacked APIs, Dashboard is now open-source for all to see. This was probably the app that took the most development time until now (still on-going!), and I think the one I'm most proud of.

I'm liking the idea of doing future releases via self-approved pull requests. Could be interesting!
