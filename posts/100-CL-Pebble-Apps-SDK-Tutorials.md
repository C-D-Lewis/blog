CL Pebble Apps (formerly Watch App Selector) now has a third tab; SDK Tutorial. It's been an idea I've had for a while, but only just got around to implementing.

This means that as well as being able to install all my published watch apps and watchfaces, users can now also see a list and be linked to my Pebble SDK tutorials.

Neat! If I write more parts to the tutorial, this app will be updated as it will for new versions of the other watch apps and watchfaces.
