So now the semester has finished, I can get down to some real coding and tutorial writing. Things to expect over the next few weeks:
<ul>
	<li>More parts of the Pebble SDK 2.0 Tutorial.</li>
	<li>Information on a basic Pebble rendering engine.</li>
	<li>A small post on my recently acquired Spark Core.</li>
</ul>
In other news, the latest versions of Watch Trigger (2.3) and Watch Trigger + (1.5) have been sent to Google Play, fixing xx-hdpi display issues and a bug when opening the front camera on the LG Nexus 5.

Stay tuned!
