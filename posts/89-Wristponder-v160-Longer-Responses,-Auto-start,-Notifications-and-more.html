After finishing my engineering dissertation, today is a day to get some coding done before starting on the next assignment sprint tomorrow.

The result is version 1.6.0 of Wristponder!

New features include:
<ul>
	<li>The maximum length of a response has been raised from 40 to 100 characters.</li>
	<li>Option to auto-start the watchapp when an SMS or phone call is received.</li>
	<li>Option to receive a notification when the SMS send is successful or fails. This is good for when signal is weak and takes longer than the alert dialog timeout.</li>
	<li>Sorting the list of responses now triggers a sync of responses where it incorrectly did not previously. Full manual sorting is coming soon, when I figure out the UI processes to use.</li>
	<li>The watchapp is now built with SDK 2.0.2. Sorry this transition from BETA6 took so long.</li>
</ul>
As a result, both the Android and watchapp require updating. The good news is that the new watchapp is bundled with the Android app with anÂ <a title="Mechanism link" href="http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/comment/103733/#Comment_103733">improved side-loading mechanism</a> that looks more robust, I hope.

A set of selectable Favourite contacts is also coming soon, but requires significant UI modification, more than a day's work. Stay tuned for that.

Enjoy!
