Updates:

## - <del>Appears the return_code from the Core is not always that which is requested. Works well for Pin D0 though.</del>

## - Source code repo updated. All Dx pins now work. Uses jQuery. <del>Still READY-TIMEOUTs though...</del>

I've revisited my control of the [Spark Core](http://spark.io) DxÂ pins, with some polishing up and JS driven UI updating so I know the response has been received from the Spark Cloud.

I'm loving working with it again, and can't wait to build some real remote controlled device, but that will have to wait for another day. I plan to release this app eventually, possibly under the name of PebbleTinker, derived from the stock [Tinker app](http://docs.spark.io/#/start/tinkering-with-tinker) for Spark Core, and all looks to be working fine, but I'm being haunted by the READY-TIMEOUT, where PebbleKit JS is killed after about ten seconds after install. Once this is fixed, I look forward to releasing!

If you want to give it a go early, the source code is partly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/C-D-Lewis/pebble-tinker).
