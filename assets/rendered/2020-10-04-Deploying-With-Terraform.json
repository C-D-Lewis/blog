If more capacity is needed it can\nbe increased by hand, and decreased when no longer needed, hopefully before\noverspending. Similarly, any changes in configuration done manually runs\nthe risk of the initial values being forgotten, and lost resources could be hard\nto restore in the same way. And if the same setup is required in a different\nregion or cloud provider, it would require almost exactly the same amount of\ntime."

      "text": "At work, we use Terraform to provision our infrastructure resources, instead of\nmanually creating them through the AWS console. Terraform is one example of a\nconcept called Infrastructure as Code. It tries to solve the problem of creating\nor modifying infrastructure in the cloud in a safe, trackable and repeatable\nway. The way it works is you describe all of the resources you require (and\ntheir configuration) as code files, and Terraform compares it with what is\nalready deployed, and makes adjustments to align with the described state."

      "type": "paragraph",

Describing an\nAuto-scaling Group of this size causes Terraform to create them, and then the\nstate reflects the fact that they now exist. The ASG can later be adjusted to\nten instances by changing a single variable and redeploying. Since the IaC files\ncan (and should) be versioned in something like Git, both the initial and latest\nconfiguration changes can be traced and used again in a different region."
