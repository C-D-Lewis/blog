      "text": "So I've had an idea in my head for a while that has probably been done before, but as I've already mentioned, I prefer to do everything I can from scratch when it comes to programming, which takes time, but is incredibly rewarding when what I strive for comes to life as I imagined."

      "text": "This particular idea is for a real-time space RPG, the main mechanic being that you set a course and a speed, and it might take a few real-time minutes to reach your destination, such that you would play the game ongoing in the background for something else you are doing, similar to an MMO."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "I've attempted this before, and the main difference in having a game world many times larger than the screen is that you must position everything relative to some abstracted co-ordinate system completely separate from where each item may be drawn on the actual screen. This was achieved before by drawing each item if it was less than a screen width or height away from the player's drawing location in the middle of the screen, then whenever the player moved it's 'co-ordinate', all the other in-game items moved in the opposite direction, very effectively creating the illusion of moving through a world, even though the player's sprite stays put on the screen."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "This feeling was further enhanced by moving the player's 'co-ordinate' using the sin/cosine of the speed and angle, allowing the player to appear to move in large smooth, sweeping arcs."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "With my new skills from recent projects still fresh in mind, I set out to make this a much tighter experience, with some more intuitive input system beyond WSAD keyboard keys. I envisaged a speed slider, and a 'ring slider' around the player in the center of the screen, allowing a course to be set and speed to be set by dragging them. As everything is done on a Graphics2D enhanced Canvas component, using pre-written Swing sliders is out of the question, so I set out to recreate these UI elements from scratch to be drawn using Graphics2D methods."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The linear slider was fairly easy, using the <code>mouseDragged()</code> method from the <code>MouseMotionListener</code> class. Position the slider where the user clicked (x co-ordinate only!) as long as it was between the slider's start and finish positions."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "So far so good."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "But the 'ring slider' required much more thinking about. I first attempted to use counters and quadrant detection of the existing angle position of the ring, but this was way too complex. Then as I was thinking about something else, the answer came to me: use GCSE maths! Specifically, the circle trigonometry stuff. It all came down to this: <a href=\"http://ninedof.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/circletheorem.png\">!<a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ninedof.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/circletheorem.png\"></a></a>So using the mouse's dragging x co-ordinate, I can find the corresponding y co-ordinate for that point around the 'ring slider''scircle. From this, the angle (theta, <b>Î¸</b>) the slider should be set to can be found using the tangent:"
