Typical uses included weather, email, news,\nagenda, etc to view at a glance while getting dressed or while passing by."

      "text": "Then, a month or so ago I saw a twist on this idea that replaced the LCD display\nand one-way mirror material with an old friend - an e-paper display. The desire\nto make one of these became real when I saw a project that put the display\ninside a wooden picture frame - a housing and stand in one! They even hid the\nRaspberry pi (obligatory at this point) round the back on the fold out stand."

      "text": "So I bought a 7.5 inch e-paper display (complete with driver HAT for Raspberry\nPi), a frame, and yet another Raspberry Pi Zero W and got to work. A few days\npixel-pushing and Googling how to do the simplest fetch/file/drawing tasks in\nPython the result is the imaginatively named\n<a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/C-D-Lewis/e-paper-frame\">e-paper frame</a>!"
