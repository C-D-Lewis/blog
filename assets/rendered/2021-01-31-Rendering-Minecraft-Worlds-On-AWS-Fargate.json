It's a Java-based\napp that loads chunks from a Minecraft world, allows you to set up a scene with\naspects such as lighting, camera, material properties, etc., and finally to\nperform ray-traced rendering of that scene. The results offer a very pretty\nview of a world that myself or a group of friends have worked hard on and gives\nan opportunity to showcase it. Here's an example of a recent world rendered from\na Christmas community server:"
