The way this works involves selecting each position in an Android Spinner in the 'Configure' tab:</p><p>!<a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ninedof.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screenshot_2014-09-07-19-46-17.png?w=576\"></a></p><p> </p><p>Each time a user makes a selection in one of the positions, the rest of the Spinner array is checked to look for a duplicate of the toggle the user has just chosen, and switches the two around. For example, if the user changes the Wi-Fi toggle to Autosync, the first toggle becomes Autosync and then the existing Autosync Spinner duplicate is changed to the only other missing toggle type - Wi-Fi!</p><p>This means that the toggles can be any order possible, such as the examples below:</p><p>!<a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ninedof.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/toggle-config.png\"></a></p><p>That's a total of P(8,8) = 40320!</p><p> </p>"
