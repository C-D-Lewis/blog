This new service had to be generic to allow all kinds of messages to flow between the services that they define themselves. It had to be fault tolerant and so should use JSON Schema to make sure the messages are all of the correct format. And lastly, it shouldn't care what the connection details are for each app at startup."

MBus responds with a randomly rolled port number from a range (making sure it isn't already allocated to another app), and the client app then creates an Express server that listens on the allocated port. If MBus receives a message with a known client app as the destination, it simply sends it on to that port within the local machine, where the client app will be listening as expected. These two processes are summarised below:"
