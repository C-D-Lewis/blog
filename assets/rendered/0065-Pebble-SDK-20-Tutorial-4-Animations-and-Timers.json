      "text": "After adding custom images and fonts to our watch face, the next logical way to improve it is to add non-static elements, movement if you will. For this we have <code>Animations</code>! Using the Pebble SDK provided <code>Animation</code> structure we can schedule movements of a <code>Layer</code>'s bounds whenever we want. This sort of \"start here and go here\" animation is called 'tweened' animation. The alternative kind offers greater flexibility and is achieved through the use of <code>AppTimer</code>s."

Start by importing the project code from the last section into CloudPebble and giving it a new name, such as 'SDKTut4' for example. Be sure to change the short and long app names in the 'Settings' section! We are going to animate the <code>TextLayer</code> showing the time when the minute changes. The first step is to change the type of tick event we subscribe to to <code>SECOND_UNIT</code> in <code>init()</code>:"

To carry out a tweened animation we create a <code>PropertyAnimation</code> instance and specify its duration, delay after scheduling (allowing sub-second timing) and a handler function to be called when it has finished to free up the memory we used in creating it in the first place. This process is summarized in the code segment below, which should be added before the <code>tick_handler()</code> function:"

The animation we will add will slide the time display out to the right hand side at <code>seconds == 59</code> and then change the time and slide it back in from the left on <code>seconds == 0</code>. To do this, we simply modify our <code>tick_handler()</code> function to create the <code>GRects</code> and call the wrapper function to schedule the animations.

The paradigm is that you register some callback (another name for handler) function to run after a given delay. When that delay has elapsed, the callback function is called and performs your task. You can think of an <code>Animation</code> as a task executed by an <code>AppTimer</code> but with a very small delay. The example we are going to create is a small shape that moves back and forth above the time display as an extra aesthetic touch."

At this rate, the delay in milliseconds between <code>AppTimer</code> callback executions will be <strong>1000ms / 25 frames per second = 40ms delay</strong>. The first step is to create a new <code>TextLayer</code> to be our shape (here, a square). Do this at the top of the C file to accompany the other pointers:"

If you think about it, there is a way to replace the moving square's <code>AppTimer</code> with a <code>PropertyAnimation</code>, rendering its use here void. A more robust example is my <a title=\"Starfield Source\" href=\"https://github.com/C-D-Lewis/starfield-demo/blob/master/src/starfielddemo.c\">Starfield Demo</a>, which uses such timers as the core of its operation.
