      "text": "In a Pebble watch app or watchface, images and fonts are referred to in the app's <code>appinfo.json</code> file, which is managed automatically for you by CloudPebble, and so will not be covered in great detail right now. Of much more importance to you now is that in the C code file, images are stored in <code>GBitmap</code> structures and fonts in <code>GFont</code> structures. Just like all the <code>Layer</code> types, they are created and allocated memory dynamically, with the function names syntactically very similar, so you will hopefully find yourself looking them up in the <a title=\"API Docs\" href=\"https://developer.getpebble.com/2/api-reference/\">API Documentation</a> a lot less."
