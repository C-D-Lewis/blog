The back button cannot be controlled by the developer as it is used to back out a watchapp to the system menu! This final step is achieved in <code>init()</code> after the <code>Window</code> is created (but before it is pushed!) like so:"

Now, in each button click handler callback function, add another <code>text_layer_set_text()</code> function call to set the text shown to that particular button.
