Sure, it's been done before, but as I have no real expertise or experience of JavaScript beyond that used for PebbleKit JS apps, and virtually none at all for HTML, it seemed like a good learning opportunity."

The solution to this turned out to be specifying the Spark.function() parameter string as a key-value dictionary, making the core (aha) code segment in this webpage as so:"

I may expand it to include more functions in the future, but at the moment it provides a good platform to play around with, and I've learned a small amount about HTML forms and using jQuery. Time well spent!"
