After being inspired by a post on Reddit, I made a watch face that imitates the '<code>time /t</code>' and '<code>date /t</code>' commands in the Windows Command Prompt. This was the result:

The result is CMD Time Typed, and looks like this:

The source is available on <a title="Source" href="https://github.com/C-D-Lewis/cmd-time-typed">GitHub</a>, and the package is available from <a title="Install here" href="http://www.mypebblefaces.com/apps/3905/10185/">MyPebbleFaces</a>. Enjoy!
