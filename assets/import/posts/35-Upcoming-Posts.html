Lots going on at the moment, so here's a list of what's coming soon (also a personal reminder!):
<ol>
	<li>Pebble SDK Tutorial Part 6 is written, just needs images. 2 Way Communications.</li>
	<li>Java <-> Pebble text bridge Android Service.</li>
	<li>Raspberry Pi obtained, working on Java <-> Pi text bridge using Pi Python.</li>
</ol>
Got to do my best not to lose sight of a current project!
